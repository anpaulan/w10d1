#The biggest challenge I had was understanding the difference between bash and zsh. When I wrote the code out, and tried to execute using bash in my terminal application, it did not run. Then I realized all I had to do was change bash to zsh when executing, and worked perfectly afterwards. 

#The other problem I had was when I was trying to open up the application within LibreOffice. I wanted to open up the spreadsheet, but because the way the application is set up, I had to update from LibreOffice Calc to just LibreOffice. Which from a practical standpoint is better, because I am able to choose the exact application I need each time, because I do not always need the spreadsheet.
